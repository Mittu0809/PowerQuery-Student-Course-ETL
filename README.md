# PowerQuery-Student-Course-ETL
This project employs Power Query to clean and analyze student course registration data from Excel. It streamlines data processing by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating fields like Student ID and Fee Status. The outcome is a clean dataset and a pivot table for efficient analysis of course registrations and fees.
